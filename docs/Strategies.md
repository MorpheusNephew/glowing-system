# Designing Strategies

Since this application is built with technology the thing that is going to be built must be something that can be automated. With this simple constraint/requirement the analysis that this application will focus on is [technical analysis][technical-analysis]. Although candle sticks looks amazing the display technically does not matter for this application. The strategies that will be modelled out comes from the training done at [Baby Pips][baby-pips].

## Strategies

There are a number of strategies based on candle sticks, but the interesting part the different strategies (coming soon) are can be based on a one, two, or three price ranges. The more price ranges involved the stronger the indicator of what can potentially happen. With these strategies being based on candle sticks there are a few questions that come up that must be answered.

- What makes the body of a pip long or short? What's how much does the open/close price have to be from each other to make it long and how close do they have to be to make it long?

- Similarly with the shadows, how far away does the upper shadow have to be from the higher of the open/close to be considered a long show and vice versa for lower shadows?
